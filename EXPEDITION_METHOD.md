# The Expedition Method

## Why Projects Fail

Most creative projects, especially in software development, encounter predictable problems:

1. **Building the wrong thing:** Far too often, teams spend months or years building something that either doesn’t work as intended or fails to resonate with users.
2. **Going over budget and over time:** Despite careful planning, projects spiral out of control, with timelines and budgets ballooning far beyond what was necessary.
3. **Overbuilding unused features:** Teams invest heavily in building features or functionality that end up never being used, wasting both time and money.
4. **Skyrocketing costs:** Inefficient planning and execution can easily cause project costs to multiply, far exceeding what was actually required.

In all these cases, in retrospect, it's trivial to identify to identify the problem: some key bit of knowledge was discovered too late. The key to project success is knowledge:

1. Generate the right knowledge
2. At the right time
3. For the right person
4. To take the right action
5. To maximize success.

## The Nature of Knowledge

> “All problems are solvable with enough knowledge.”

The difference between failure and success is always just knowledge. Your success will always be determined by how successfully you create the knowledge you need in time to use it.

The Expedition Method is a "knowledge engine" for all creative projects, especially software development. The overarching goal is:

> “Create the **right knowledge** at the **right time** so the **right person** can take the **right action** to maximize success.”

After all, if a project fails, it's almost always trivial to look back and say "if only we knew X before we started, we could have succeeded". The trick is to transform this 20/20 hindsight into 20/20 foresight.

## The Bridge and The Expedition

> “Creating software is more like mounting an expedition than building a bridge.”

### Software is not a bridge

Software projects are always running out of budget and missing deadlines. When they launch at all, they are often buggy or poor quality. Most of all, they all too often miss the mark and simply flop in the market. The problem is we still build software like we are building a bridge. We attempt to estimate everything - a process everyone knows is impossible. We make Gantt charts and timelines, and we attempt to create enormous backlogs - glorified to-do lists - so that designers & engineers can act like mindless workers that translate detailed specifications into code. The problem is the false belief that, like bridge-building, it’s possible to gather all the knowledge we need before we break ground.

### Software is an Expedition

In reality, 90%+ of the knowledge you need for success is not even available until well after you after start creating. Like an expedition, you don’t really know what the exact destination is when you start. You don’t know what unexpected obstacles you’ll run into along the way, and you don’t know what new opportunities you’ll discover. Instead, like an expedition, the path to software success is to define the high-level goal, ball-park estimate the whole project, double it so you have capacity to deal with the unknown but inevitable road-bumps, and get started. Then, on a weekly basis, gather what you’ve learned, refine your goal, update where you are on the map, identify known obstacles and send out scouts to investigate them. Finally, take all that knowledge, pick the best path to make progress over the next week and keep moving.

## The Expedition Method

All expeditions start with the same process:

1. Envision: Define the goal & initial strategy
2. Provision: Estimate the whole project using a rough, power of 2 estimate, double it for unknowns, and then gather the resources you need
3. Embark: Get started!

The main part of any expedition is the journey, but we'll get to that in a moment.

### Envisioning the Goal and Initial Strategy

Start with "Why?": What is the problem you are trying to solve? What human needs are you fulfilling? Who does it impact? Why does it matter? This is no trivial question, and answering it well is essential. However, it's beyond the scope of the Expedition Method. Instead, I refer you to someone much more qualified to guide you towards finding your "why": Take a look at Simon Sinek's [How great leaders inspire action Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) his excellent book [Start With Why](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/).

Once you have your "why" (and that is not a static thing, it will evolve over time), the next step is to design a strategy. For any given problem, there are many possible strategies. You need to pick the one that strikes the optimal balance between cost, impact, speed, risk and whatever other factors are critical to your project. Ideally you'd come up with 3-5 strategies that each solve the problem in a different way, and then pick the one that maximizes your team's chances of success.

### Provisioning for the Expedition

Depending on the project you may need to do a detailed provisioning, or you may be able to completely skip this part, e.g. if it's a personal side project.

A few points:

- only order-of-magnitude estimates are really possible at the beginning of a new project
- only estimate what it'll take to get to the next "resupply point" - your next validation, release or perhaps your next funding round

### Embarking on the Expedition

Get started! Build something. Launch something. Ship something. Do whatever it takes to get to the next "resupply point." Better to ship early with a partial solution, get feedback, iterate and ship again.

> "Most projects fail for one simple reason: they ship too late."

## On the Journey

While on the expedition, you need two key things: progress and direction. Progress in the wrong direction is pointless. Direction without progress equally so. A successful expedition requires continuous orientation and relentlessly putting one foot in front of the other. This requires an intentional, recurring process. We’ll assume a weekly cadence, though it can be more or less frequent depending on your team’s needs.

Once a week, repeat these steps:

Good call! Here’s an update that keeps “knowledge” central:

1. **Plot**: Mark your current position on the map.
2. **Reflect**: Review key knowledge gained over the past week.
3. **Reorient**: Refine your overall goal and strategy in light of new knowledge.
4. **Scout**: Identify what knowledge you need right now and how you can gather it.
5. **Navigate**: Select the best path forward given what you know.
6. **Advance**: Take action!

### 1. Plot

Identify clearly where you are on the map. A critical part of making progress towards your goal is knowing where you are.
This should be objective and as easy as possible to do and understand. Some things to track:

1. Progress towards the goal: the most important thing is to track where you are relative to the goal. In general, attempt to define your goal in terms of measurable sub-goals. It doesn't have to be perfect. If you want to mark some progress from the previous week that doesn't fit into the current goal definition, expand the definition. In the Expedition Method specifically, we have a repeatable methodology for tracking progress which we'll cover below.
2. Track time: Time is usually the most precious resource we are attempting to minimize over the whole project. The old adage says "what gets measured gets managed." Identifying what took longer than expected or ended up being surprisingly easy can be extremely helpful in refining the overall goal and finding the shortest path to success. Of course, the Expedition Method has you covered with a repeatable methodology for tracking time.

### 2. Reflect

The most important question is what knowledge, if we'd known it earlier, would have made a difference? This is the critical muscle to exercise to maximize your chances of success. What knowledge is crucial for success, and how can you gather or create it? Consider these questions, and document them—it’s part of the process for mastery.

1. Which problems were worked on, and how much time was spent on each? Was it less, more, or equal to what was expected? Why?
2. Was anything surprising learned?
3. What would have helped us to know earlier, no matter how small?
4. If we had a magic crystal ball, what would we like to know right now to help us in the next iteration?

Agile teams may recognize this as similar to a sprint retrospective—but this is better. It focuses on one core question: **What knowledge, if we’d known it earlier, would have made a difference?** That’s all that truly matters. This means there’s a mini-retro every week, preventing the common agile problem of retros happening too late.

### 3. Reorient

Based on what you’ve learned in step 1, the goal may need adjustment. Teams often resist changing goals, but it’s crucial to embrace this flexibility. The goal isn’t a fixed promise—it’s an evolving plan for the expedition. Here are some ways goals can shift:

- **Major pivots**: These are rare but significant changes to the overall goal.
- **Refinements**: These are more common and stem from new information:
  - Better understanding of the target customer, the problem, or the solution space.
- **Priorities shift**:
  - Something was easier than expected—is this a new opportunity we can take advantage of?
  - Something was harder than expected—is this a new opportunity to find an alternative strategy?
- **External factors**: News, competitors, research, or other inputs can lead to goal adjustments.

### 4. Scout

After reviewing your status, you’ll need to identify what lies ahead. Are there obvious obstacles blocking the way? What key questions remain unanswered, and how critical are they to the next steps? Think of this as scouting ahead, identifying where to send your “expedition scouts” for deeper investigation.

### 5. Navigate

Based on everything you’ve learned, the team should now focus on gathering the most critical knowledge or solving the most urgent problems. Set priorities for the next week:

- Which problems should the team focus on first?
- Which knowledge will have the biggest impact on success?
- What actions are needed to remove obstacles or answer key questions?

This is your roadmap for the next cycle. Stay adaptable, but clear on the immediate priorities.

### 6. Advance

Now, put the plan into action. Execute the prioritized tasks, gather the critical knowledge, and start preparing for the next weekly cycle.

### Minimizing Meetings

> "The only good meeting is a canceled meeting." – said someone

Generally, steps 1-5 happen in a weekly team meeting. Initially, as you’re learning the process, doing all five steps together in the meeting is good practice. Once your team is comfortable, aim to minimize meeting time by having individuals prepare steps 1 and 2 in advance. A quick review of everyone's findings can help you reach step 5 quickly, allowing most meetings to be completed in under 30 minutes. Yes, that means you can do a retro, sprint plan, and grooming session in under 30 minutes each week.

## The Expedition Method In Detail

### Goals, Strategies and the Project Tree

With the Expedition Method we have a very specific way of defining strategies. A strategy is simply the list of sub-problems you need to solve in order to solve the main problem. Each sub-problem needs its own, clear "why" that answers the question "Why is solving this sub-problem important for the main problem?". These sub-problems can be considered the requirements for the main problem. If all the sub-problems are solved, then main problem is solved. The key is to select the smallest set of sub-problems that can possibly solve the main problem, and no more. Question every requirement.

> "Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous because people are less likely to question them. Always do so, even if the requirement came from me. Then make the requirements less dumb." - Elon Musk

Now, here's where the magic happens. Because of the way we've defined "strategies" and "sub-problems", we can continue to break down each sub-problem into even smaller problems until we get down to the level of problems we know how to solve.

This is the "project" tree. It is top-down, in the good way, starting with the overarching "why" what we are doing matters, and then filling in just enough detail to orient the team so they can start making progress. Throughout the Expedition Method your team will be updating and refining the project tree with the learnings from each iteration.

The project tree serves two important purposes:

1. It aligns the whole team, no matter how many people are working on the project, towards the overarching goal. It provides a direct path connecting problems to solutions all the way down to concrete actionable work items.
2. The project tree is used to track the status of the project.

#### Tracking Project Status with the Project Tree

Every node in the project tree, a problem that, when solved, will contribute to solving the problem above it, will have a status. In general there may be many ways to measure status, but we use the following "readiness levels" which are based on Nasa's similar list. They are:

0. Plan: A plan has been started - merely creating an entry in the project tree is not enough.
1. Spike: a demonstration of feasibility in the form of a small but non-trivial piece of working code that mitigates the technical risks. Significantly, all external integrations have been proven to work.
2. Prototype: a partial demonstration of how the solution will work, in code, for real
3. Alpha: a solution that works, at a basic level, for at least one happy path
4. Beta: a solution that works, at a basic level, for all happy paths
5. Industry-Standard: a solution that works, at a basic level, for all happy paths and all edge cases
6. Industry-Leading: for the parts of your project that constitute your competitive edge, you can spend more resources to make it industry-leading
7. World-Class: The solution not only meets industry standards but excels in performance, usability, and scalability, setting it apart globally. It is recognized for exceptional quality and reliability.
8. World-Altering: The solution redefines an entire category, creating a paradigm shift that influences the broader industry or even society. It changes how people approach the problem or interact with the solution space.
9. Epic: The solution leaves a lasting legacy, inspiring innovation across multiple domains. It has an enduring impact on both technology and culture, influencing generations to come.

As a simpler alternative, you can simplify this into three levels, using our alternative "3-star" method:

0. 0-star: A plan has been started
1. 1-star: Equivalent to RL1 - you've mitigated the technical risks
2. 2-star: Equivalent to RL5 - industry standard
3. 3-star: Equivalent to RL6+ - industry leading

The 3-star method is simpler, but it still captures the two most risky, time-consuming and difficult parts of software development:

1. **External integrations**: These are inherently outside of your control and often lack complete documentation. The only way to confirm they work is by building and testing against the actual service or tool.

2. **Main build**: Once all external dependencies are fully understood, building an industry-standard solution becomes more predictable. With a clear scope, the time required for the core development can be reasonably estimated.

3. **Polish**: Like external integrations, polish is hard to predict. It's easy to get lost in the pursuit of perfection and never ship. The challenge is knowing when it's good enough—focusing on the areas that truly matter without over-polishing aspects that don't.

The Expedition Method uses breadth-first plan for making progress. Whether you are using the Readiness Levels or the 3-star method, the goal is to focus on which-ever sub-problem has the lowest status and focus on make progress on it. This helps the team focus on mitigating technical risks early and avoiding perfectionism until after the entire product is shippable. At that point the business can pull the trigger at any time while the dev team focuses on polishing the solution to delight customers.

# TODO

- "deliverables" are a subset of the project tree joined with specific status-goals for each item using Readiness Levels or 3-star method.
- tracking time (against items in the project tree)
- levels of the expedition method:
  1. just the project tree
  2. start tracking status on the tree
  3. start tracking specific deliverables OR time
  4. start tracking both time and deliverables
