# Why?

Project "success" is elusive and difficult, but one thing is for certain. At the end of the project it's always easy to look in the rear view mirror and say "if we'd done XYZ things might have gone differently."

The Expedition method is 100% focused on getting the right knowledge to the right person at the right time so they can take the right action that leads to maximum project success.

# Strategy

1. track status, not TODOs - where are we now and where are we ultimately going
2. use "milestones" - specific project statuses that we are working on achieving now - to prioritize and focus the work right now
