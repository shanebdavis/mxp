Option to "sync with map" on a waypoint with a map link:

# Gather Info

1. `mapSubWaypoints`: find all the current sub-waypoint nodes with map links
1. `nonMapSubWaypoints`: find all non-map sub waypoints
2. `currentSubMaps`: find all sub-map-nodes from the map tree

# Sync

Goals:

- make the waypoint sub tree mirror the map sub-tree
    - for nodes that exist in the old and new waypoint tree, keep their metadata, but change the hierarchy to match the map tree
- set the target RL for all new nodes to match the root waypoint's target RL
- for removed map nodes: create an "old maps" sub-waypoint
- for non-map sub waypoints: keep with existing parent
