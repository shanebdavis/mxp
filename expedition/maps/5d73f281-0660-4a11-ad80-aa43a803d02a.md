It would be very helpful to see that SOME progress has been done when we are otherwise at, say, RL0. 

Basically:

```typescript
const baseline: number // find minimum, floored child RL level

const boundedChildrenRLs: number[] // bound all children RL level between [baseline, baseline + 1]

const finalRl: number // take the average over boundedChildrenRLs
```
