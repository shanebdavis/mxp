# View by Milestone

A dropdown at the top of the solution map tree allows you to select which milestone you are viewing the status by. 

## Readiness Levels by Milestone

This is a replacement for the active and draft feature we currently have for solution-map nodes. 

if a node in the tree is not connected to the current milestone then it doesn't count towards its parents' readiness level. Essentially, it can be considered a _draft_ or future-req from the perspective of the currently viewed milestone. 

## New Nodes by Milestone

I think new nodes don't get any explicit assignment to the currently viewed milestone. If any of its ancestors are assigned to the milestone, it will inherit those by default via the normal rules. 

## Definitions

A solution-map node is attached to a specific milestone IFF

1. it is directly assigned to it
2. one of its parents are directly assigned to it
3. or it or its parents are assigned to a prerequisite milestone
