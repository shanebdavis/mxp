# Track Status, not To-Dos

1. a hierarchy
2. each node is a problem to be solved
3. children represent the strategy - a list of sub-problems that, if solved, will solve the parent problem
4. each node has a readiness status
5. nodes can have their readiness set explicitly or automatically - the latter is either RL0 if there are no children or the min value of all the children
